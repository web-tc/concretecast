    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <img src="/img/brickwork.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px;">
    <p>
      ConcreteCast UK is a family run business, with over 5 years of specialist expertise. We take pride in all our products in order to accomplish the most satisfaction for our customers and consumers.
    </p>
    <h2>Highest Quality Products</h2>
    <p>
      Quality, price and service are our primary focus. All products are throughly inspected with our quality control team before dispatch. We ensure our products have a stronger blend of quarried aggregates. All our concrete is produced systematically and contains 10mm gravel aggregate, concrete sand and a high-performance cement. This resolves to a concrete with a 45-50 N/mm2 strength mix.
    <h2>Industry Leading Machinery</h2>
    <p>
      Every gram of aggregate and cement is accurately weighed before entering the batching plant by using our extremely large weighing platforms. This ensures every mix will be optimal and consistent, which reduces the margins for error significantly.</p>
    <h2>Best For Service</h2>
    <p>
      We at ConcreteCast UK strive to achieve the most excellent service and products to ensure our clients have a phenomenal experience when dealing with us.
